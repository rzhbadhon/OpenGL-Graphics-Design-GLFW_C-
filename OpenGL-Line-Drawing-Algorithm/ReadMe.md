# OpenGL Triangle Color Changer

A simple OpenGL application that displays a triangle with animated colors. The triangle gradually changes color over time, and turns red when the `ESC` key is pressed.

## 🔧 Features

- Renders an upside-down triangle using OpenGL
- Uses GLSL shaders for custom coloring
- Dynamic color change using `sin()` animation
- Pressing `ESC` sets the triangle color to solid red

## 🛠️ Built With

- [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) – for creating the window and handling input
- [GLAD](https://glad.dav1d.de/) – for managing OpenGL function pointers
- C++ (tested with `g++` on Windows)
